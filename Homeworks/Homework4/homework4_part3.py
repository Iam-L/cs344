Assignment Instructions:

For this homework, do the following things:

Speculate on whether you believe that so-called “deep” neural networks are destined to be another bust just as
perceptrons and expert systems were in the past, or whether they really are a breakthrough that will be used for
years into the future. Please give a two-to-three-paragraph answer, including examples to back up your argument.

Hand-compute a single, complete backpropagation cycle. Use the example network from class and compute the updated
weight values for the first gradient descent iteration for the AND example, i.e., [1, 1] → 0. Use the same initial
weights we used in the class example.

Build a Keras-based ConvNet for Keras’s Fashion MNIST dataset (fashion_mnist). Experiment with different network
architectures, submit your most performant network, and report the results.
